## What this project is
Coptic Root is a centralized platform designed to collect and organize online Coptic Orthodox resources. It aims to make key texts, media, and institutional content easily accessible to both Coptic Christians and interested scholars. The project serves as a digital hub for literature, media, diocese directories, magazines, and other relevant resources.

## Why it matters
The Coptic Orthodox Church has a deep and rich heritage, much of which is scattered across various websites, apps, and archives.

Coptic Root makes this wealth of information discoverable and usable through a unified, searchable interface.

It preserves cultural and spiritual heritage while making it more accessible to younger generations and non-Egyptian Copts.

It supports clergy, laypeople, educators, and researchers with a trustworthy source of curated content.
